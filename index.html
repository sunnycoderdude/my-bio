    <p>Welcome to my homepage! My name is Satinder "Sunny" Singh and I am an aspiring programmer and accomplished financial analyst. My career has spanned a wide variety of roles within global finance. Following my undergraduate studies at NYU, I spent my analyst years at Deutsche Bank and TPG focused on distressed real estate debt. I made the switch over to the public markets as an associate within the long/short equities group at Citadel. I am currently on an extended garden leave and will be joining Millennium as an analyst covering real estate securities.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I have always had a passion for programming having taken a variety of classes at NYU. While I focused on building my investing career, I kept my programming skills sharp by writing scripts in VBA. I believe the marriage between data science and finance will only continue to strengthen. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In order to remain a step ahead of my peers and prepare for the future, I am currently enrolled in the full stack coding bootcamp at Columbia University. I hope to turbocharge my programming skills and add a few new arrows to my quiver and become a sharper investor.</p>
